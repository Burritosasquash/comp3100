the pros and cons of the three different scheduling methods:

- First-fit (FF)
- Best-fit (BF)
- Worst-fit (WF)


* First fit:

- Pros:

1. finds the first sever with available resources meaning it can complete the task.

- Cons:

1. if no server available it will go to first server it finds with available resources regardless of availability.

2. Will end up having all servers active if large amount of jobs, this is bad for cost as the larger servers could be hosting jobs that a small server could handle and it would be cheaper.

total cost:

$1.05


* Best fit:

- Pros:

1. will match the job with the server with a suffient amount of cores.
2. sticks to the idea of allocating to the first server of those who are fit, for example if server 1 and server 3 are both fit, server 1 will be selected.

- Cons:

1. because the alogrithm only sorts based on core count it does not factor in other elements such as memory or disk space, though it will find a server that fits those requirements it may use a server that costs more to run.

total cost:

$1.05

* Worst fit:

- Pros:

1. will always be able to run the jobs as it will alsways go for the server with the largest core.

- Cons:

1. similar to best fit however in reverse, it will choose the last of the servers that are seen to be fit.

total cost:

$1.07 

worst fit is the most expensive as it demands the highest resources.
